# Heart Disease Prediction System

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.

## Features
- Logistic Regression Model
- Data Preprocessing & Scaling
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy)
- Streamlit Web Application

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit joblib

2. Train model:
   python train_model.py

3. Run app:
   python -m streamlit run app.py

## Output
